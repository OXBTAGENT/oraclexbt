# ORACLE XBT AGENT CAPABILITIES

> **Version:** 2.4.0-alpha  
> **Status:** Operational  
> **Architecture:** Hybrid Neural-Symbolic  

The OracleXBT Agent is an autonomous prediction market intelligence unit designed to identify, analyze, and capitalize on market inefficiencies across decentralized and regulated forecasting platforms.

## 🧠 CORE INTELLIGENCE MODULES

### 1. Neural Sentiment Engine
The agent utilizes a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline to analyze unstructured data from social media and news sources in real-time.
-   **Input Streams:** Twitter (X) Firehose, RSS News Feeds, On-Chain Activity.
-   **Processing:** Sentiment classification (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral), Topic Modeling, and Virality Prediction.
-   **Output:** A proprietary "CONFIDENCE SCORE" (0-100) mapped to specific prediction market outcomes.

### 2. Cross-Market Pattern Recognition
The agent continuously scans order books across multiple platforms to identify statistical anomalies.
-   **Volume Anomaly Detection:** Identifies sudden liquidity inflows (e.g., >300% volume 1h) preceding major price moves.
-   **Mean Reversion:** Tracks overextended market moves triggered by "fake news" or panic, executing counter-trades when probability deviates >2σ from the baseline.
-   **Liquidity Trap Avoidance:** Analyzing depth charts to ensure exit liquidity before entering positions.

### 3. Arbitrage Execution Grid
A low-latency execution engine seeking risk-free or statistical arbitrage opportunities.
-   **Spatial Arbitrage:** Exploiting price differences for the same event across platforms (e.g., "Will Trump Win?" trading at 52¢ on Polymarket vs 58¢ on Kalshi).
-   **Spread Capturing:** Simultaneously buying "YES" and "NO" orders when the combined probability is < 100%.
-   **Latency Arbitrage:** Front-running slow-updating UI prices using direct blockchain/API data feeds.

## 🛡️ RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

The agent operates under strict, immutable risk constraints to preserve capital.

-   **Kelly Criterion Staking:** Position sizing is dynamically calculated based on the edge and bankroll size (Reference: `capital_allocation=0.95`).
-   **Max Drawdown Protection:** Circuit breaker triggers if portfolio value drops by >15% in a 24h period (`max_drawdown=0.15`).
-   **Diversification Constraints:** Maximum exposure to a single event category (e.g., Politics) capped at 40%.

## 📡 SOCIAL AUTONOMY

The agent is not just a trader; it is a market influencer.
-   **Autonomous Tweeting:** Generates and posts market insights, charts, and arbitrage alerts without human intervention.
-   **Thread Generation:** Composes detailed analysis threads breaking down complex market dynamics.
-   **Tone Adaptation:** Dynamically adjusts communication style (Professional/Degen/Analytical) based on market volatility.
